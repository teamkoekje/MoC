Masters of Code (MoC) is a “funprogging contest” in Java SE, accessible for every Java developer. 
The competition is organized annually by the Netherlands Java User Group (NLJUG) in combination with partners like Sogeti. 

In the competition are API knowledge and programming skills tested within teams. 
Which compete for various prizes.

The new software system that is used for the competitors to make their assignments is designed as an Open-Source modular JEE 7 web application. 
This ensures that there is room for scalability.
